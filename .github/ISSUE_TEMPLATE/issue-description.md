0) Please describe your issue in detail (Pack Version, Forge Version, problem/issues)

1) If you've encountered a game crash, please upload your crash report to a pastbin site and provide a link only (pastebin or equivalent.) to keep clutter down.

2) If you have an issue with the quest book or a certain crafting recipe try to provide a picture for better clarity

3) Please don't post issues if you modified the pack (or removed or added mods) modifying may cause issues with crashes and world corruption so harder to pinpoint variables beyond stock modpack.

4) Delete rules after write-up as re-posting rules isn't necessary.

5) Thanks everyone!
