#Server Notes For Admins#

-Remember to Backup your world(s) before updating!!!

-Warning!!! -This update (2.1.1) is no longer using the Roots 2 mod version. Roots 2 is now Roots 3 and pack updated to Roots 3 Mod version. Current Quests and future updates will reflect this change. Updating will likely break existing roots 2 world progress due to item changes and quests that used Roots 2 mod. You will likely have to redo Roots 3 quests and progress/items. Backup your worlds before updating to 2.1.1!!!
-If server gets stuck when on load up after updating server on a currnet world, type /fml confirm in the console, wait a few minutes as the server will backup the old world, then proceed loading.
