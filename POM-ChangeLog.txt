Backups can be manually performed with the command "/backup start"
Backups are saved as .zip files in a folder called "backups" in the minecraft directory.

#Server Notes For Admins#

-Remember to Backup your world(s) before updating!!!

-Warning!!! -This update (2.1.1) is no longer using the Roots 2 mod version. Roots 2 is now Roots 3 and pack updated to Roots 3 Mod version. Current Quests and future updates will reflect this change. Updating will likely break existing roots 2 world progress due to item changes and quests that used Roots 2 mod. You will likely have to redo Roots 3 quests and progress/items. Backup your worlds before updating to 2.1.1!!!
-If server gets stuck when on load up after updating server on a currnet world, type /fml confirm in the console, wait a few minutes as the server will backup the old world, then proceed loading.

-Win_start_server.bat= if running windows os server
-Linux_launch.sh= for linux os server

-Running one of these scripts, will gen the server, remember to edit server.properties to your liking IP, ports, memory, whitelist,ect.

# Quest-book update=Once loaded up, Remember to run run these commands as admin or op on server:
